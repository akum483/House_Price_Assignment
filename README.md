# House Price Prediction (Advance Rergession Assignment)
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
 The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
 For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.


## Table of Contents
* [General Info] : The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

* [Technologies Used] : Python

* [Conclusions] : Ridge regression performs better than lasso with better R score Metric for Train and Test Data
Lasso Regression can be used to get Predicting Variables in the Model

## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
- How well those variables describe the price of a house



## Conclusions
-   Ridge regression performs better than lasso with better R score Metric for Train and Test Data.
-   The Ridge model has too many dependent variables.
-   Ridge has many variables with non-zero coeff. making it difficult to select Predicting Variables. 
-   Lasso Regression can be used to get Predicting Variables in the Model

Some of the Variables that helps in Predicting Sales Price are:
1.  OverallQual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house
2.  LotArea: Lot size in square feet
3.  RoofMatl: Roof material
4.  GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
5.  MSZoning: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale


## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Statsmodels
